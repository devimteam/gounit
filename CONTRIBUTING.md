Contributing to GoUnit
======================

First, thank you for contributing!

## Workflow
Before check the [open issues][issues] and [pull requests][prs] for existing discussions.

- Fork the project.
- Make your bug fix or feature addition.
- Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version 
unintentionally.
- Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Please make sure that you have [set up your user name and email address](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) 
for use with Git. Strings such as `nick name <root@localhost>` look really stupid in 
the commit history of a project.

Pull requests for bug fixes must be based on the current stable branch whereas 
pull requests for new features must be based on the master branch.

We are trying to keep backwards compatibility breaks in GoUnit to an absolute 
minimum. Please take this into account when proposing changes.
